    This file gives a quick introduction into the fawkeZ project setup.

    B U I L D I N G   T H E   P R O J E C T

    PREREQUISITES

        * Java Development Kit >= 1.4.0
        * Ant >= 1.6.5

    THIRD PARTY DEPENDENCY
    
     o GraphViz                                                     [OPTIONAL]
       http://www.graphviz.org/
       The GraphViz package is required to render diagrams generated by the
       documentation task. The 'dot' command line tool must be available
       in the default path.

    If you are behind a proxy, you need to configure the following Ant
    properties:

      o For proxy without proxy authentication:
          proxyHost
          proxyPort

      o For proxy with proxy authentication:
          proxyHost
          proxyPort
          proxyUser
          proxyPass

    You can put these properties in your user property file
    (config/${user.name}.properties) or specify them on the ant command
    line like this:

        ant dist -DproxyHost=proxy -DproxyPort=80

    and then fire up Ant

        /path/to/ant/1.6.5/bin/ant dist

    To execute the JUnit testcases, you need the junit.jar on your classpath:

        export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/fawkez/lib/default/junit/junit.jar

    This is a brief list of all the files in this directory and for what
    they are used. Also includes major configuration files.

    README
        This file

    AUTHORS
        Project's authors.

    CHANGES
        Summarize changes that are 'visible' to the 'outside' (after
        first release).

    build.xml
        Project build file includes config/properties.xml and
        lib/ant.properties.

    DIRECTORIES

    build (*)
        All files that are generated at compile time MUST be stored here.
        Java source files that are generated by an idl compiler MUST be
        stored here too.
        Neither this directory itself nor any files in it are added to the
        CVS system.
        Subfolders like /build/classes, /build/docs, /build/gen-java,
        will be created as used.

    dist (*)
        This directory is the one and only source for the productizing
        team [and QA]. The "ready to productize" product will be and MUST
        be stored here. Files that are not intended for distribution MUST
        NOT be placed in this folder.
        If there is a universal productizing subfolder structure, this
        should be used.
        Neither this directory itself nor any files in it are added to the
        CVS system.

    lib
        Contains 3rd party jar Archive for the compile and test targets
        that cannot be resolved dynamically.

    lib/default (*)
        Contains 3rd party jar Archive that are resolved dynamically.

    docs
        Development documentation (preferred 7-bit ASCII).
        ASCII filenames should use upppercase letters and no extension,
        e.g. TODO. See plain documentation style guide.

    config
        Compile time configuration for the Ant build process is stored here.

    config/properties.xml
        This file contains mostly static properties and path settings used
        in the build.xml. Maybe overwritten by user specific property file.

    src
        Contains any sources. See below.

    test
        Contains any test related stuff e.g. JUnit Test, test-data or
        test-scripts. See below.

    tools
        Contains project related tools used exclusive at compile time,
        e.g. code generator, build-report-generator or cruise control
        stuff. See below.

    (src|tools|test)/java
        Contains the java sources. Subfolders represent the java
        packaging. So /java/com/jcoderz/foo/ is the lowest level
        directory to put FOO related sources in. Classes in the test
        directory matching the JUnit naming schema "*Test.java" must
        contain valid JUnit testcases.

    (src|tools|test)/sql
        Contains all database create scripts needed for installation,
        tools or testing.

    (src|tools|test)/bin
        Contains scripts.

    (src|tools|test)/xml
        Contains XML source. See subfolders.

    (src|tools|test)/etc
        Contains runtime configuration files.

    (*) This directory is generated during the build process.
