Fawkez 1.2 'Charlie X'

  * New features:
  * Update to fop 0.94
  * Update to xerces 2.9.1
  * Update to commons-httpclient 3.1
  * Update to commons-cli 1.1
  * Update to docbook-xsl 1.73.2
  * Update to FindBugs 1.3.3 (#45) (JRE 5 required)
  * Update to PMD 4.1
  * Update to fb-contrib 3.4.2
  * Update to Checkstyle 4.4
  * Fixed bugs: #43 #50 #53
  * The log messages can now use a custom logger to log to and
    does not need to use the logger assigned to the LoggableImpl.
    Therefore the LogMessageGenerator ant task has 2 more
    parameters: allowUseOfBaseLogger and customLoggerClass
  * The LogFormater now also respects java text formating in
    trace messages (was broken).
  * Generated types now throw more detailed exceptions for
    length and value range validations.
  * Generated StrongTypes (immutable ones) do implement a
    common interface (StrongType).
  * The jcreport can now read emma 'es' files to as coverage
    info. http://emma.sourceforge.net/
  * The generated value objects do now have a copy constructor if
    they do not have a final and initialized field.
    For generated type changes please also check out:
    https://www.jcoderz.org/fawkez/wiki/SimpleTypesGenerator
  * User type names camel case alignment was not correct. A member
    of a value type named 'TestValue' got the name 'mTestvalue' but
    should be mTestValue. Take care since this changes the interface
    of the generated code!
  * Generated service level exceptions are now abstract to prevent
    them from being directly used.
